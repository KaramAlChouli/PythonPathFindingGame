# Python Path Finding Game

## Overview
Python Path Finding Game is an interactive game developed in Python using the Pygame library. The game involves navigating a user-controlled sprite through a grid with obstacles, while avoiding collision with a moving enemy sprite.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Control a sprite using keyboard inputs to navigate through the grid.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance**: Avoid dynamically generated obstacles and a moving enemy sprite.
- **Path Finding Algorithm**: Utilizes A* pathfinding algorithm to move the enemy sprite towards the player.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pygame library for game development
- A* pathfinding algorithm for enemy movement

## Game Mechanics
1. **User-Controlled Sprite**: Move using 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys.
2. **Obstacles**: Randomly generated and placed on the grid.
3. **Enemy Sprite**: Uses A* pathfinding to move towards the player.
4. **Game Over**: Occurs when the player sprite collides with the enemy sprite.

## Setup and Running
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python and Pygame are installed.
3. Run `PythonPathfindingGame.py` to start the game.
